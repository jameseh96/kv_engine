/**
 * Static definitions for statistics.
 *
 * Requires a STAT macro be defined before including this file.
 * STAT(uniqueName, ...)
 *
 * where:
 *  * uniqueName - a key which identifies the stat (used as the enum value
 *                  and cbstats key)
 * and the remaining optional parameters are:
 *  * unit - name of a cb::stats::Unit which identifies what unit the stat
 *           value represents (e.g., microseconds). default: none
 *  * familyName - the metric name used by Prometheus. This need _not_ be
 * unique, and can be shared by stats which are distinguishable by labels.
 * default: uniqueName
 *  * labelKey - key of a label to be applied to the stat. default:""
 *  * labelValue - value of a label to be applied to the stat. default:""
 *
 * Stats should be formatted as
 *
 * STAT(unique_name, unit, family_name, labelKey, labelValue)
 *
 * e.g.,
 *
 * STAT(get_cmd, microseconds, cmd_time_taken, "op", "get")
 * STAT(set_cmd, microseconds, cmd_time_taken, "op", "set")
 *
 * The uniqueName will be used as an enum key, and as the stat key for
 * backends which do not support labelled stat families (e.g., CBStats).
 *
 * The familyName and labels will be used by backends which _do_ support
 * them, like Prometheus. All stats of a given family_name should be of the same
 * unit (e.g., count, bytes, seconds, kilobytes per microsecond) and it should
 * be possible to meaningfully aggregate the stat values e.g., get_cmd and
 * set_cmd can be summed.
 *
 * Only uniqueName is mandatory. The minimal definition of a stat is therefore
 * STAT(uniqueName)
 * For stats with unspecified units and no labels. In this case, the uniqueName
 * will also be used as the familyName.
